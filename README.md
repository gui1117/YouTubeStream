# YouTubeStream

Get a YouTube Stream and open it with a local application.

Share a YouTube video with this application or use the clipboard.
The application then retrieves the stream and opens it with a local application (VLC is a compatible local application).
The video is then handled by the local application, which can allow to put it in the background (VLC allows it).
